\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello, my name is Ben Feistmann and I am a Computer Science student at UCF that is looking for a work.  I have almost two years of the programming experience that I've collected through various school projects, internships, and personal projects.  I am in the pursue of more experience in the industry.  I love being faced with a problem and finding the most effective way of solving it.  I believe that the fast pace, challenging atmosphere that the industry provides is an arena that satisfies that craving for me.  I know that I can be a great asset to your software development team and I am a fast learner.   }
