~~~~~~~~ FUNGI ~~~~~~~~~

	Mycidiamicata
	How fungi feed?
		Absorptive heterotrophs
	Cell walls made of chitin
	Lifestyles
		Decomposers
		Animal Parasites	
		Mutualistic symbiosis	
	Majority of fungus lives undergos
	Hypae - filamentous cell
	Mycelium
	Reproduce
		Asexually
		Sexually
			Tips of mycelium touch and fuse
			The nuclei stay the same
			Karyogamy -> fusion fo nuclei
	Know all the fungi phyla

~~~~~~~~ PLANTS ~~~~~~~~~

	Land plants derived from green algae
	Rose-shaped complex
	peroxisome enzymes
	Phragmoplast - structure formed suring cell divsion
	
	Unique to plants
		Aprical Meristems - like stem cells
		Alternation of generations - 2n sporophyte <-> n gametophytpe
		Walled spaores in sporangia - there spores have sporapollien - prevents decicating in non water environments
		
	Non-vascular - Bryophytes
	Vascular - seedless
	Vascular - seed
	
	Non-vascular - Bryophytes
		Water is necessary for reproduction because they have flagellated sperm
		Sporophyte grows grow gamophytes - gamophyte dominate (mature) in plants life
		
	Seed - Sporophyte embryo packed w/ food
		Evolution of flowers and fruits - attracts pollenators	
		Flower -> fruit (dry or fleshy)
			dry -> wind or animal	
			fleshy -> animals eating them

~~~~~~~~ ANIMAL DIVERSITY ~~~~~~~~~

	What is an animal?
		1.
		2.
		3.
		4.
	Cambrian Explosion
		Animal diversity exponentially grow
		Reason:
			Increase in O2
			Simple changes in the Hox Gene
	95% - invertibrate
	75% - insects
	35% - beetles
	
	Development
		...

	Hox gene 
		Coordinates development
		
	Animal Phylogeny
		1. All start off as Diploblastic, no tissue, asymmetry
			a. the sponges
			b. have a unqiue cell called the collar cell
		2. Muscle/nervous tissues/ radial symmetry
			a. Cnideria
			b. Gastorvascular cavity
			c. no digestive track
		3. Bilateral symmetry / triploblastic
			
		3 Basic body parts of the Molluscs
